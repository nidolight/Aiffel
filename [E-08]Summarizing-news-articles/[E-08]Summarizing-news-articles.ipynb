    "텍스트 전처리, rnn신경망, 어텐션 메커니즘을 사용한 seq2seq, Summa의 추출적 요약 등 자연어 학습에 대하여 전반적으로 알아보았습니다. 비슷한 방식으로 텍스트 번역과 같은 다른 분야에서도 사용될 수 있다는 점이 흥미로웠습니다. 하지만 직접 구현하였을 때의 학습결과가 미흡했습니다. 데이터 전처리부분이 조금 부족한 것이 원인인 것 같은데 학습하는데 시간이 너무 오래 걸려 여러가지 시도를 해보지 못하여 아쉬웠습니다.<br>\n",
    "문법완성도 측면에서는 seq2seq을 사용한 추상적 모델이 조금 더 우수한 것 같고, 핵심단어 포함 측면으로는 Summa를 이용한 추출적 요약이 우수한 것 같습니다. 아무래도 Summa의 추출적요약은 문장 내의 단어들을 추출하여 그대로 사용하기 때문에 핵심 단어를 포함하게 되고 추상적 모델에서는 문자를 생성해 내기에 핵심 단어를 포함시키지 않는 경우가 생길 수 있습니다."
